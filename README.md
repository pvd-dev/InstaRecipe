# ðŸ¥˜ ðŸ¥£ InstaRecipe -- 12.000 recipes served instantly
_InstaRecipe is a Flask webapplication that serves 12.000 recipes instantly, it gets it's recipes from the [breakfast API](https://github.com/MariiaSizova/breakfastapi) and based on the name of the recipe it fetches an image using RapidAPI ._ 

**Check out the demo:** https://flask-service.vdotvo9a4e2a6.eu-central-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/

# Installation
- You can easily download the project and add your RapidAPI key and run it locally 
- However I also made a Docker Image

```
docker pull petervandoorn/insta-recipe
```

# Why such a fuss for such a simple app? 
If you're reading this you probably have much more experience developing software than I do. To be frank: It took me more than a week to build this app, spending many late hours googling the most basic questions on stackoverflow. Anyway: I'm genuinly very proud as it's the first time I built something with so many moving parts. For now it will serve as a portfolio project as it's currently the pinacle of my softwaredevelopment skillset, using all kinds of technology I was unfamiliar with. 
Lastly I'm writing this up as a memento to myself and other aspiring developers that if you really sit down and do the work, you can learn and achieve more than you ever expected. 


# Goal for the project: 
- Build a webapp with a backend -- I used flask for the very first time
- Do some kind of session related logic -- In my case I ended up storing favourites in the session
- Use an API and learn how to send data to the frontend -- Breakfast API was very convenient as it did not deal with authentication and returns very straight forward fields. 
- Use a frontend framework -- In this case Bootstrap
- Wrap the whole app in a docker container for easy distribution
- Use AWS for hosting -- I developed using an EC2 instance and later I used Lightsail to host the docker image. 

# Known issues or things that I did not get to work yet:
- Setting a javascript spinner in the button on getting a new Recipe
- Storing the current recipe in the session -- these are now used system wide, causing some glitches if multiple users use the site at the same time
- Damn DNS on Lightsail -- will try to figure that one out over the weekend.
