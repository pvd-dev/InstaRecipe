# ðŸ¥˜ ðŸ¥£ InstaRecipe -- 12.000 recipes served instantly
_InstaRecipe is a Flask webapplication that serves 12.000 recipes instantly, it gets it's recipes from the [breakfast API](https://github.com/MariiaSizova/breakfastapi) and based on the name of the recipe it fetches an image using RapidAPI ._ 



**Check out the demo:** http://instarecipe.nl or this [link to the container on Lightsail](https://flask-service.vdotvo9a4e2a6.eu-central-1.cs.amazonlightsail.com/)

# How it works:
- The premise is that you'll get a recipe, instantly. Only 1 at a time to make things simple in this rather complicated world
- Upon startup InstaRecipe will store 1 recipe in memory this one will be served first to someone visiting the app
- This user can then pick either 2 things: 1 to get a new Recipe or 2 to store the current recipe in his or her favourites
- If you opt for a new recipe then a new recipe will be loaded
- If you opt to store as a favourite, then you can hop over to your favourites tab and check out the recipes you have saved
- That's about it :D 

# Installation:
- You can easily download the project and run locally 
- Simply add a `keys_config.cfg` file to the folder
- and add you rapidAPI keys use this template
```
[RapidAPI]
api_key = PASTE YOUR API KEY HERE
```

- However I also made a Docker Image to make things even more simple to run, just pull the image and run the app. 

To download the docker image:
```
docker pull petervandoorn/insta-recipe
```
To run the container on port 80 (The flask app serves on port 5000)
```
docker container run -p 80:5000 [insta-recipe]
```

# Why such a fuss for such a simple app? 
If you're reading this you probably have much more experience developing software than I do. To be frank: It took me more than a week to build this app, spending many late hours googling the most basic questions on stackoverflow. Anyway: I'm genuinly very proud as it's the first time I built something with so many moving parts. For now it will serve as a portfolio project as it's currently the pinacle of my softwaredevelopment skillset, using all kinds of technology I was unfamiliar with. 
Lastly I'm writing this up as a memento to myself and other aspiring developers that if you really sit down and do the work, you can learn and achieve more than you ever expected. 


# Goal for the project
- Build a webapp with a backend -- I used flask for the very first time
- Do some kind of session related logic -- In my case I ended up storing favourites in the session
- Use an API and learn how to send data to the frontend -- Breakfast API was very convenient as it did not deal with authentication and returns very straight forward fields. 
- Use a frontend framework -- In this case Bootstrap
- Wrap the whole app in a docker container for easy distribution
- Use AWS for hosting -- I developed using an EC2 instance and later I used Lightsail to host the docker image. 

# Known issues or things that I did not get to work yet:
- Setting a javascript spinner in the button on getting a new Recipe
- Storing the current recipe in the session -- these are now used system wide, causing some glitches if multiple users use the site at the same time
- Damn DNS on Lightsail -- will try to figure that one out over the weekend.
